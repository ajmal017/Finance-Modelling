Bondanalytics is a python class that I have started working on to develop fixed income analytic tools.



Currently it has a workable funtion, named bootstrapper that takes 3 inputs:
  1) A pandas dataframe that includes tenor, price and coupon rates for a bond
  2) discount frequency, for example frequency will be 2 if payments are semiannual
  3) Face value of bond in question
function will then return the input dataframe along with an additional column that include spot rates



I hope to continue to include additional fixed income analytic models in time. I am currently working on another function that will enable bond valuation using binomial pricing
